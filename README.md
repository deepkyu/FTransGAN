# Font Style Transfer across multiple languages (Draft)

This is the unofficial implementation for the paper [Few-shot Font Style Transfer between Different Languages](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Li_Few-Shot_Font_Style_Transfer_Between_Different_Languages_WACV_2021_paper.pdf). The original implementation from the author can be found [here](https://github.com/ligoudaner377/font_translator_gan).

## Updates

`2022.12.04`

This code is a part of my final term project in _Special Topics in Computer Science - Introduction to Deep Learning (CS492I)_ (2022 Fall, KAIST).  
The goal of my proposal is to generate novel fonts for a certain language, whose style is transferred from fonts for other languages.  
In this project, I used [google/font](https://github.com/google/fonts) repository to define [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) dataset, which contains font images from 10 different languages.  

However, I failed to generate fonts for unseen languages. Instead, I'll share some results in training dataset to explain the core concept of this project.

Hope that I could finish this project successfully in some days :)

## Main concept

## To be continued...

- [ ] how to see the evaluation results
- [ ] how to train the model
- [ ] what will I do for the next step...

- [x] finish the military service in South Korea
- [ ] finish the undergraduate course and (might) go to graduate school...
